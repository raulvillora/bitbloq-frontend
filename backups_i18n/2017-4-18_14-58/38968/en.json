Bitbloq uses this paradigm because it has been proven to be effective among children, and also because Scratch is already used in many schools and education centres. Our philosophy is that it\u00b4s better to join forces than to reinvent the wheel. We have developed Bitbloq using open source software libraries, primarily Bloqs, a library developed by BQ for creating online applications using blocks.",
